# Instana TypeScript Example

This is a trivial Node.js application to showcase how to integrate Instana into a TypeScript based Node.js project.

It is loosely based on https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter but reduced quite a bit.

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
